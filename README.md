- 👋 Hi, I am Ronnie Cyrus.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, and writing codes to bring to life a few ideas I have had in mind.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, Java and C++ simultaneously, at a self-taught pace.  I just scratched the surface of my journey.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with employers in the near future to acquire employment and continue my love affair with software engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me?  You can contact me on this platform, or at my email:  cyrusronnie26@gmail.com.  My cell # is (+1868) 327-2730.
